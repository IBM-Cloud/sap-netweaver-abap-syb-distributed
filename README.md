## 1.1 Installation media
SAP Netweaver installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP Netweaver 7.5 and SAP ASE 16** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## 1.2 VSI Configuration
The VSIs are deployed with one of the following Operating Systems: Suse Enterprise Linux 15 SP3 for SAP Applications (amd64), Suse Enterprise Linux 15 SP4 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP Applications (amd64).

For Netweaver primary application server
- ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-applications-2
- ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-applications-2
- ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-applications-2
- ibm-sles-15-4-amd64-sap-applications-4

The VSIs should have least two SSH keys configured to access as root user and the following storage volumes created for DB and SAP APP VSI:

SAP Netweaver PAS VSI Disks:
- 1 x 32 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA
- 1x 32 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 64 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA
- 1 x 128 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA
- 1 x 256 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

In order to perform the deployment you can use either the CLI component or the GUI component (Schematics) of the automation solution.

## 1.3 VPC Configuration

The Security Rules inherited from BASTION deployment are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group for private networks.
- Allow outbound traffic  (ALL for port 53, TCP for ports 80, 443, 8443)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP for port 22) from IBM Schematics Servers.

## 1.4 Files description and structure

The solution is based on Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks executed by Schematics and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules.
 - `ansible`  - directory containing the SAP ansible playbooks.
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for the deployment of the current SAP solution.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (VPC, Hostname, Private IP).
 - `integration*.tf & generate*.tf` files - contain the integration code that makes the SAP variabiles from Terraform available to Ansible.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI.
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.
 - `sch.auto.tfvars` - contains programatic variables.

## 2.1 Executing the deployment of **Standard SAP Netweaver and ASE installation** in GUI (Schematics)

### IBM Cloud API Key
The IBM Cloud API Key should be provided as input value of type sensitive for "ibmcloud_api_key" variable, in `IBM Schematics -> Workspaces -> <Workspace name> -> Settings` menu.
The IBM Cloud API Key can be created [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

### Input parameters

The following parameters can be set in the Schematics workspace: VPC, Subnet, Security group, Resource group, Hostname, Profile, Image, SSH Keys and your SAP system configuration variables. These are described in [General input variables Section](#15-general-input-variables) section.

Beside [General input variables Section](#15-general-input-variables), the below ones, in IBM Schematics have specific description and GUI input options:

**VSI input parameters:**

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
ibmcloud_api_key | IBM Cloud API key (Sensitive* value).
private_ssh_key | Input your id_rsa private key pair content in OpenSSH format (Sensitive* value). This private key should be used only during the terraform provisioning and it is recommended to be changed after the SAP deployment.
ID_RSA_FILE_PATH | The file path for private_ssh_key will be automatically generated by default. If it is changed, it must contain the relative path from git repo folders.<br /> Default value: "ansible/id_rsa".
BASTION_FLOATING_IP | The FLOATING IP from the Bastion Server.

**SAP input parameters:**

### Steps to follow:

1.  Make sure that you have the [required IBM Cloud IAM
    permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to
    create and work with VPC infrastructure and you are [assigned the
    correct
    permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to
    create the workspace in Schematics and deploy resources.
2.  [Generate an SSH
    key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys).
    The SSH key is required to access the provisioned VPC virtual server
    instances via the bastion host. After you have created your SSH key,
    make sure to [upload this SSH key to your IBM Cloud
    account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console) in
    the VPC region and resource group where you want to deploy the SAP solution
3.  Create the Schematics workspace:
    1.  From the IBM Cloud menu
    select [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview).
       - Click Create a workspace.
       - Enter a name for your workspace.
       - Click Create to create your workspace.
    2.  On the workspace **Settings** page, enter the URL of this solution in the Schematics examples Github repository.
     - Select the latest Terraform version.
     - Click **Save template information**.
     - In the **Input variables** section, review the default input variables and provide alternatives if desired.
    - Click **Save changes**.

4.  From the workspace **Settings** page, click **Generate plan** 
5.  Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform
    execution plan.
6.  Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**.
7.  Review the log file to ensure that no errors occurred during the
    provisioning, modification, or deletion process.

The output of the Schematics Apply Plan will list the public/private IP addresses
of the VSI host, the hostname and the VPC.

 ## 2.2 Executing the deployment of **Standard SAP Netweaver and ASE installation** in CLI

 ### IBM Cloud API Key
For the script configuration add your IBM Cloud API Key in terraform planning phase command 'terraform plan --out plan1'.
You can create an API Key [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
 
### Input parameter file
The solution is configured by editing your variables in the file `input.auto.tfvars`
Edit your VPC, Subnet, Security group, Hostnames, Profile, Image, SSH Keys and starting with minimal recommended disk sizes like so:
